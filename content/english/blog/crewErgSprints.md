My boat, the women's 8+, won first place at the Capitol Sprints race in the summer of 2021. My boat also won third in the women's 4x at the Philadelphia Youth Regatta the same summer, both for Washington Rowing School. I absolutely love crew and have been so fortunate to race with wonderful people.

I individually placed second in the 500m sprint in the lightweight category at the Mid-Atlantic Erg Sprints 2020, for Blair crew. This winter season crew competition involves rowing on an ergometer stationary rowing machine. Read more about my experience on Blair High School crew [here](https://celestebasken.com/crew/).
