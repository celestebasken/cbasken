I've been involved with the youth-led Sunrise Movement for two years and am now a hub coordinator. In spring 2021, the team that I led within my local hub of the movement convinced our County Council and County Executive to endorse the Federal Green New Deal and call on the Biden Administration and Congress to take a strong stance on climate. Below is the press conference where my Sunrise hub announced this achievement, including a speech I gave about the personal impacts the climate crisis has had on my life.
