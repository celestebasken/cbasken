I love Model United Nations because it combines public policy and public speaking, which are both things I enjoy. In Model United Nations, I research my given country and their history, politics, economy, environment, and anything else relevant to the topic at hand.

I was awarded Best Delegate at the Garfield Model United Nations Conference in Fall of 2019.
