## Award-winning climate and agriculture film

I created [this documentary](http://studentcam.org/ThirdPrize-0422MontgomeryBlair.htm) in spring of 2020 for the C-Span StudentCam documentary competition. My group shot original b-roll, conducted investigative research and interviewed farmers, policy experts and a sitting US Congressman. 

The film was nominated for Fan Favorite and won Third Place in C-Span Competition. It also won an award in the [Ghandi Brigade Youth Media competition](https://www.youthmediamd.org/media-festival-competition) and was screened at the [All-American High School Film Festival](https://www.hsfilmfest.com/2020-official-selections).
