## Gerrymandering film

I created [this documentary](https://www.viddler.com/v/778f881e) in spring of 2018 for the C-Span StudentCam documentary competition. My group shot original b-roll, researched historical precedents and interviewed policy experts and a former US Congresswoman. 

The film was awarded an Honorable Mention.
