## Mycorrhizal networks film

I created this original animated science video in the spring of 2020 when I had available time due to the coronavirus pandemic. I interviewed experts, drafted a comprehensive story for a youth audience and edited it together using animated graphics.

My film placed in the top 5% internationally in the [Breakthrough Junior Science Video competition](https://breakthroughjuniorchallenge.org/).
