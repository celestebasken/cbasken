## Producer of the documentary film program SilverLens

As the producer of my school's documentary film program for the 2020-21 school year and executive producer of the entire 70-student media program for the 2021-22 year, I've overseen the creation of many incredible films. These student-produced works were primarily created by other members of SilverLens staff, and I provided guidance and editing support.  

The over 20 no-budget student-created films that I've produced won awards such as Third Place in C-Span's StudentCam competition.
