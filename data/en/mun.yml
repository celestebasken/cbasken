  title : "I'm an officer of my school's Model United Nations team."
  content : "I love Model United Nations because it perfectly combines history, politics, debate, and cooperation. Through Model UN I've learned the fascinating history of countries across the world and discovered how to think about politics and the role of global citizens. Public speaking and leadership are essential to Model UN, and I've found the conferences have emboldened me as a speaker and organizer."
